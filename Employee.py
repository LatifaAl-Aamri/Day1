Exercise Write a Python class Employee with attributes like emp_id , emp_name ,
emp_salary , and emp_department and methods like calculate_emp_salary ,
emp_assign_department , and print employee_details .
Sample Employee Data : " ADAMS " , " E7876 " , 50000 , " ACCOUNTING "
" JONES " , " E7499 " , 45000 , " RESEARCH "
" MARTIN " , " E7900 " , 50000 , " SALES "
" SMITH " , " E7698 " , 55000 , " OPERATIONS "
